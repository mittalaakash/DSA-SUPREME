1) Code middle of the linked list using length approach.
2) Linked List is circular or not. 
  -> Using Single Pointer
  -> Using slow and fast pointer
  -> Using map
3) Find and count function in map.
4) Should we write slow!= NULL in the LOOP where fast!=NULL ??
5) Can we apply slow and fast to the find whether circular linked list or not?
6) Find a case where prev = fast thing will fail while we remove the loop in linked list.
